    "|<center><h2><a href=\"Open-FF_Synonyms.html\">Chemical synonyms</a></h2><center> |This searchable table lists alternative names for the chemicals published in FracFocus. Although it is not an exhaustive set (around 100,000 synonyms for about 1400 compounds published in FracFocus and other fracking data sources), it may help you find  alternative names for a given CAS number or possible CAS numbers for a given name|\n",
    "|<center><h2><a href=\"Open-FF_CASNumber_and_IngredientName.html\">CAS-Ing pairs</a> </h2><center>|This interactive table helps the user see how the raw FracFocus fields **CASNumber** and **IngredientName** were curated into the Open-FF **bgCAS** values.  This curation is necessary because there are many correctable mistakes that, once fixed, give us a more complete record of chemical use.|\n",

    "|<center><h2><a href=\"Open-FF_Companies.html\">Company name table</a></h2><center>|The raw FracFocus data for company names is not standardized.  A single company may be named by dozens of labels in the data.  Without correcting this proliferation of names, searching the data is very tedious.  Open-FF uses a hand-curated translation table to translate the numerous versions into a single name.  The two FracFocus fields that are the 'input' for this table are *OperatorName* and *Supplier*. The three Open-FF fields that use the output of the table are *bgOperatorName*, *bgSupplier* and *primarySupplier*. |\n",
    "|<center><h2><a href=\"Open-FF_TradeNames.html\">TradeNames Index</a></h2><center>| This experimental table lists all tradenames and the bgCAS numbers associated with them.  Use this table to find what is reported in a particular product or to find which products a particular chemical ends up in.  You can also use the table to look for variations in how a particular product is reported. **(in development)** |\n",

The other tables provide information about the process of identifying the carrier records in disclosures. |\n",
    "|<center><h2><a href=\"Open-FF_Auxillary_Data.html\"> Other data sets</a></h2><center> |The data sets described here are related to the main bulk download set, but for various reasons, are not directly connected. For example, chemical records for the 2011-2013 period that were scraped from FracFocus's PDF files are summarized here. |"
